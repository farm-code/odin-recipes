# odin-recipes
My first project of The Odin Project!
I'll be creating a simple html site that will have a homepage and links to three recipes. I think the html will be pretty straightforward and I won't have any problem with that, but I'll be practicing using Git and GitHub. I haven't practiced much with those so that part still feels a bit unnatural to me.
